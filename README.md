## bumpin'


Soft Skill is an important requirement in all the fields in today's era. 60% people get rejected in their interviews due to lack of confidence and their inability to express themselves. 
There is a need for a virtual environment in which people can train themselves in an interactive way while crossing the levels of all the modules of the training through a game. 
In this virtual game, that would be played through "VR", at the end of each module, there will be a question related to the previous module to asses the progress.  
The trainer will be the bumpin' avatar. 
The number of coins collected will be reflected on the global leader board while making the way for the opening of next module of the training.

The second model of the bumpin' includes the AR quiz app for the school students to enhance their interest via interactive studies. The app contains quizes from different subjects like English, Mathematics, Science etc.
Though it will be a subscription based application but it will be cost effective to enrich the culture of interactrive studies hence it is fun to learn!!
